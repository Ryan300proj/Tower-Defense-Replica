## üéÆ Gameplay Instructions

1. **Launch Game:** Run the compiled executable.  
2. **Select Level:** Choose from Easy (18x18), Normal (12x12), Hard (8x8), or Custom.

### Custom Map Creation
If you select "Custom", you'll enter the map editor:

1. **Set Map Dimensions:**
   - Enter width and height values (8-20) for your custom map.
   - Use number keys to input values.
   - Press Tab to switch between width and height fields.
   - Click "Confirm" or press Enter when done.

2. **Place Start Tile:**
   - Left-click on a grid cell to place the starting point (green tile).
   - This is where critters will spawn.

3. **Place End Tile:**
   - Left-click on a different grid cell to place the ending point (red tile).
   - This is where critters will try to reach.
   - Note: Start and end tiles cannot be adjacent to each other.

4. **Create Path:**
   - Left-click on cells to create a continuous path (brown tiles) connecting the start and end points.
   - The path must form an unbroken connection.
   - You can only place path tiles on empty (gray) cells.

5. **Validate Map:**
   - A validation message will appear when you've created a valid path.
   - Right-click anywhere to confirm and proceed to the game when the validation message appears.
   - If you make a mistake, press the "Restart" button in the top-right corner to reset the map.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - If you try to create an invalid configuration (e.g., disconnected path), an error message will appear.
   - Try to create a continuous path from start to end without gaps.

### Game Controls

1. **Purchase Towers:**
   - Click the **Shop** button in the bottom-right corner to open the tower purchase menu
   - Select a tower type (Basic, Area, or Special) to view its stats and cost
   - After selecting a tower, click on valid ground tiles to place it
   - Your available gold is displayed at the top of the screen

2. **Place Towers:**  
   - **Left-Click** on valid positions to place towers.

3. **Start Waves:** Press the **Start Wave** button to initiate enemy waves.  

4. **Defend Your Base:** Prevent critters from reaching the end by strategically placing towers.

5. **Life Points:** Monitor your remaining lives shown in the top-left corner. Game ends when lives reach zero.

6. **Inspect Entities:** Hold **Alt** while hovering over towers or critters to see detailed information.

7. **View Controls:** Click the **Controls** button in the bottom-left corner to display key bindings.

8. **Restart:** After winning or losing, press **R** to restart the game.

## üß© Design Patterns Implementation

### **Strategy Pattern (Tower Targeting)**
The Strategy pattern is implemented with multiple concrete targeting strategies that towers can dynamically switch between:

- **Smart Targeting Strategy:** A balanced approach considering multiple factors like critter health and position
- **Exit Proximity Strategy:** Prioritizes critters closest to the exit point
- **Strongest First Strategy:** Targets critters with the highest health
- **Weakest First Strategy:** Targets critters with the lowest health
- **Closest First Strategy:** Targets critters nearest to the tower

The system includes a **DynamicTargetingManager** that automatically selects the most appropriate strategy based on the current game conditions:
- Number of critters
- Presence of Level 3 boss critters
- Tower type (Basic, Area, Special)
- Critter proximity to exit

This implementation allows towers to intelligently adapt their targeting behavior as the battle evolves without requiring player intervention.

### **Factory Pattern (Critter Wave Generation)**
The Factory pattern is used to create different types of critter waves based on game progression:

- **Easy Wave Factory:** Creates waves of basic critters (early game, Wave 1)
- **Medium Wave Factory:** Creates mixed waves of basic and medium critters (mid game, Wave 2)
- **Hard Wave Factory:** Creates waves with medium and boss critters (late game, Wave 3+)

This pattern provides a clean separation between wave creation logic and the rest of the game.

### **Decorator Pattern (Tower Upgrades)**
The Decorator pattern is used to dynamically enhance towers with various upgrades:

- **Base Decorators:**
  - **RangeUpgradeDecorator:** Increases tower range
  - **PowerUpgradeDecorator:** Increases tower damage
  - **FireRateUpgradeDecorator:** Increases tower attack speed

- **Special Decorators:**
  - **Level3CritterFocusDecorator:** Prioritizes level 3 critters
  - **AoERadiusEnhancerDecorator:** Increases area of effect radius
  - **RefundValueBoosterDecorator:** Increases tower sale value

This pattern allows for flexible tower customization without creating an explosion of tower subclasses.

### **Observer Pattern (UI Updates)**
The Observer pattern enables efficient communication between game components:

- **MapObserver:** Monitors changes to the map and updates the visual representation
- **TowerObserver:** Tracks tower state changes and ensures proper rendering
- **CritterObserver:** Keeps the critter visuals in sync with game state changes

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### UI Resizing:
The UI components dynamically adjust to window size changes, maintaining proper aspect ratios and relative positioning. This applies to both the game interface and the custom map editor.

### Life Points System:
Life points are tracked in the CritterSpawner class, with different critter types deducting varying amounts when reaching the exit. The game over state is triggered when life points reach zero.

### Entity Inspection:
Inspection tooltips are implemented using the Alt key modifier and provide real-time information about towers and critters. The data is formatted and displayed in readable tooltips.

### Health Bar System:
Critter health bars use SFML shapes with dynamic sizing based on current health percentage. The system provides visual feedback through color changes and positioning.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility:
The game uses preprocessor directives to handle platform-specific code, allowing it to run seamlessly on both Windows and Linux systems.

### Controls Dialog:
A dedicated UI component shows all game controls when the Controls button is clicked. The dialog is positioned centrally with clear formatting and a semi-transparent overlay for better readability.

### Shop System:
The shop interface allows players to select from different tower types, displaying relevant statistics and costs. The system integrates with the player's currency system to enforce purchase limitations based on available gold.
